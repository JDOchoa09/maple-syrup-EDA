Exploring domestic maple syrup production data to understand influencing factors and seasonal trends through data analysis.

# Maple Syrup Production Analysis

Welcome to the **Maple Syrup Production Analysis** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of domestic maple syrup production data, focusing on understanding the factors that influence production levels and identifying seasonal trends.

## Project Overview

The maple syrup industry is of significant economic and cultural importance. This project delves into the dynamics of maple syrup production by analyzing key variables such as yield per tap, average price, and overall production. By conducting thorough data exploration, visualization, and hypothesis testing, we aim to shed light on the relationships and patterns within the industry.

## Objectives

1. Investigate the correlation between yield per tap and overall maple syrup production to understand tapping efficiency's impact on production levels.
2. Analyze the relationship between average price per gallon and maple syrup production to uncover market dynamics' role in influencing production.
3. Explore potential seasonal patterns in maple syrup production across different years, revealing insights into seasonal variations and contributing factors.
